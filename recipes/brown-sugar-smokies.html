    <h2>How to cook the famous Brown Sugar Smokies</h2>
    <p>These bacon-wrapped little smokies with a brown sugar glaze are yummy! You can make these little smokies on skewers or toothpick them to secure.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bacon</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package little smokie sausages</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar, or to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to follow</h3>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Cut bacon slices into thirds and wrap each strip around a sausage. Secure the wrapped sausages on wooden skewers, several to a skewer. Arrange the skewers on a baking sheet and sprinkle them liberally with brown sugar.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp and the brown sugar is melted, about 20 minutes.</p>
