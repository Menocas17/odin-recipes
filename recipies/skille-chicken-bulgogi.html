    <h2>How to cook the famous Skillet Chicken Bulgogi</h2>
    <p>This bulgogi chicken is a quick-and-easy, but very tasty, meal. You can substitute the chicken with beef or pork for variety. My wife and I absolutely love this recipe, and it only takes 30 minutes with very few dirty dishes! Serve over rice.</p>
